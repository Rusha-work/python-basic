What's python & why is it popular?\n","   - Python is a programming language which was developed around 1991 . It is popular for various reasons. Which are as follows ;\n","    1.  It's easy to learn .\n","    2.  It has a lot of libraries.\n","    3. It's easy to read and it also has has huge community.\n","    4. It's versitable.\n","2.What's an interpreter in python?\n"," - It's a program that reads& executes python code for us to see results Immediately.Immediately.It translates the code into machine readable language.\n","3. What're pre-defined keywords in python ?\n","  - these're pre-defined words that hold special meaning.meanireng.They' used for specific purposes.purposes.Like - Print,if,type etc.\n","4.Can keywords be used as variable name?\n","   - No,variable is a reserved memory space for storing values.values. So keywords can't be used.used. keywords are uesd for performing certain tasks within python.\n","5. What's Mutability in python?\n"," -  Mutability in python refers to the changeable value of objects which is already created.created.i.created.created.i.e it can be changed after being created.\n","6. Why lists are mutable but tuples are immutable?\n","  -  Items can be assigned to list.list.But it can't be done to tuples. The contents can be changed in lists but in tuples it's not possible. So, tupletuples are more memory efficient.\n","7.What is the difference between '== '& is operators in Python?\n"," - In python '==' compares the value of different objects  & 'is'  sees if it refers to the same object in memory.\n","8.What are logical operators in Python?\n"," - logical operators help to evaluate multiple conditions by determining overall true value.value.like - and, or & not.\n","9.What is type casting in Python?\n"," - the process of changing data type of any object~\n"," or values is known as type casting.Because there can be mismatch between the data types.\n","10.  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n"," - In case of implicit type casting python understands the data & works accordingly. In case of\n"," explicit type casting we've to convert the data type by using inbuilt functions.\n","11. What is the  purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n"," - The  purpose of conditional statements in Python are ; a) it helps to deal with real life situations as involves lots of conditions with various outcomes.\n"," b) they control the flow of code executexecution.\n"," c)they can improve programming efficiency.\n","12.How does the elif statement work?\n"," - It's used in python to check multiple conditions. If the condition is false then it moves to the next condition through  using this keyword.\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n"," - While loops  represents  continuous repetition of a block of code until a certain condition is made. And for loops represent  iteration of a sequence of elements.\n","14. Describe a scenario where  while loop is more suitable than for loop.\n"," - Promting a user for input until a valid response is achieved - could be a scenario  where  while loop is more suitable than for loop. As no. of iteration is unknown in advance."],"metadata":{"id":"oDbmj6pGE1_Z"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"RW8MxegpE10R"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":106},"id":"kXtZUxqoEzuW","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1746553619369,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"RUSHA DAS","userId":"08623274289586900751"}},"outputId":"64ed13c1-1a5c-4f7b-a412-9ab667a746fd"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"IndentationError","evalue":"unexpected indent (<ipython-input-8-0bc851b80645>, line 2)","traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  File \u001b[0;32m\"<ipython-input-8-0bc851b80645>\"\u001b[0;36m, line \u001b[0;32m2\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    print (\"Hello world!\")\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mIndentationError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m unexpected indent\n"]}],"source":["# 1. write a Python program to print \"Hello world!_\n","'''print (\"Hello world!\")'''\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#  2.
